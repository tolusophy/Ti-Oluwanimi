<p align="justify"> It seems like I've gotten your attention! Hey there! I'm Toluwani, your friendly neighborhood AI enthusiast. I build and write AI stuff sometimes. I am also a Machine Learning PhD Student at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae">MBZUAI</a>. When I'm not boring <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=VcOjgngAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a> with Machine Learning puzzles and thesis duties, I'm disturbing <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/zhang.html?source=about_page-------------------------------------">Prof. Kun Zhang</a> on how to transfer our smartness and intelligence to these machines. My current focus is to outsmart sneaky vision models with adversarial attacks or crafting adversarial shields for VLMs. Before this, I worked on projects in the Responsible and Trustworthy AI domain, specifically, in privacy and fairness. </p>

<p align="justify"> Here's a sneak peek at my tech toolbox: Python, PyTorch, C#, VB.Net, Visual ["Studio", "Studio Code"], GitHub. Yep, it's quite the ensemble! There's a lot more, but I don't want to show off. </p>

<p align="justify"> When I unplug from the matrix, I dive into spirited debates about whether we're heading towards a tech utopia or just brewing the next batch of conspiracy theories. Philosophy? Love it. The meaning of life? Come here Aristotle! Let's chat over any game... I would say my gaming prowess is "uniquely charming." I'm also a fan of staying active, whether it's sports or gym sessions where I do nothing but lift my weary body through my fiery spirit.
</p>

<p align="justify"> Even with all my weirdness, music is my soul's language. I've got the softest spots for Country and Folk, and I love humorous songs. I strum, sing, and tinkle the ivories, adding my own soundtrack to life. Oh, and I've recently dabbled into photography â€“ I wouldn't call myself talented, but I keep shooting at "nouns". Bad, or great shots... Both, I'll enjoy! I also love comedy, but that talent evades me, though you can find a little touch on my platforms.

Got a cool research idea or just want to muse about the future? Hit me up!
