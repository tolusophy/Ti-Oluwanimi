<p align="justify"> Hi! Toluwani here! I study, play, and interact with AI stuff sometimes. I am currently a Doctoral Student at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae">MBZUAI</a>, studying Machine Learning and working under the guidance of  <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=VcOjgngAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Prof. Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</a> and<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Karthik Nandakumar</a>, while also collaborating with  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/zhang.html?source=about_page-------------------------------------">Prof. Kun Zhang</a>. My current research focuses on adversarial attacks on vision models, and adversarial defense methods for VLMs. Previously, I worked on projects in the Responsible and Trustworthy AI domain, specifically, in privacy and fairness. </p>

<p align="justify"> Here are some technologies I have been working with: Python, PyTorch, C#, VB.Net, Visual ["Studio", "Studio Code"], GitHub.</p>

<p align="justify"> Beyond the realm of academia and research, I love having a discussion about futuristic utopia, tech trends, conspiracy theories, and philosophy of life and living. While my gaming skills may leave something to be desired, I'm always up for a friendly match of FIFA or PES. Physical activities also hold a special place in my life, whether it's sports or hitting the gym for that confidence boost. Music is a constant companion, with a penchant for Country and Folk, while I try my hand at singing, guitar, and piano. In the past year, I've dabbled in photography, and I did find myself in situations where I had to "shoot" at people, objects, and buildings creatively.

I am open to collaborations and can be reached through the following channels:
